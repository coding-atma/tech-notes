| Bullshit Asymmetry Principle | `The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it`                                      ||
|          Knuth's Law                   | `Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.    `                                                        |                                                        |
|          Conway's Law                    | `Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.` |                                                        |
